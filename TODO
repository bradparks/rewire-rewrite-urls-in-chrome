Release blockers:
UI for custom duration for a filter
Time allowed displayed in notication must be dynamic
oauth for facebook.com needs to continue to work
Make ui pretty

Make Icons:
  19: browser bar item
  38: larger browser bar
  16: context menu
  48: extension list
  128: ?

should 16x16 icon be different for "unwire"?

HIGH:
urls displayed in notification message are wrong if you click on a link that redirects you
context menu helper unwiring fails on URL-shortened links
add functionality to challenge on unsuspend again
update context menu item to show only when the link is one that is blocked
deal with requests that aren't main_frame

LOW:
don't use regexs for URL patterns?
track statistics on time spent on each site (not in incognito mode) and # of unwires
Make it harder to remove an entry from the deny list (passphrase? time-based?)
disallow copying/pasting if challenge restored
